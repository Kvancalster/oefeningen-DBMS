Exercise slide 42
	show model organisms full name (as one column): genus + species

		MariaDB [biodb]> select concat(genus," ",species) FROM modorg;

	Genome size (as Gb, standard: Mb), rounded to 4 digits
		[ note: standard in Mb (how in original table) show it in Gb
									1000 Mb = 1 Gb --> gsize/1000 ]
		MariaDB [biodb]> SELECT concat(genus, " ", species), round(gsize/1000,4) FROM modorg;
	Average chromosome size per organism
		MariaDB [MariaDB [biodb]> select concat(genus, " ", species),round(gsize/1000,4), gsize/nchr FROM modorg;
	Publication year (draft contains a date, need to extract the year with a function)
		MariaDB [biodb]> select concat(genus, " ", species),round(gsize/1000,4), gsize/nchr,year(draft) FROM modorg;
	sort by average chromosome size, largest on top
		MariaDB [biodb]> SELECT concat(genus, " ", species), round(gsize/1000,4), gsize/nchr, year(draft) FROM modorg ORDER BY gsize/nchr desc;
	COMPLETE + USE OF ALIAS
		MariaDB [biodb]> SELECT concat(genus, " ", species) as species, round(gsize/1000,4) as gsizeGb, gsize/nchr as avgChrSize, year(draft) FROM modorg ORDER BY avgChrSize desc;
