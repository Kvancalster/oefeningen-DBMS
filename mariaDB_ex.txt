Exercise slide 42
	show model organisms full name (as one column): genus + species

		MariaDB [biodb]> select concat(genus," ",species) FROM modorg;

	Genome size (as Gb, standard: Mb), rounded to 4 digits
		[ note: standard in Mb (how in original table) show it in Gb
									1000 Mb = 1 Gb --> gsize/1000 ]
		MariaDB [biodb]> SELECT concat(genus, " ", species), round(gsize/1000,4) FROM modorg;
	Average chromosome size per organism
		MariaDB [MariaDB [biodb]> select concat(genus, " ", species),round(gsize/1000,4), gsize/nchr FROM modorg;
	Publication year (draft contains a date, need to extract the year with a function)
		MariaDB [biodb]> select concat(genus, " ", species),round(gsize/1000,4), gsize/nchr,year(draft) FROM modorg;
	sort by average chromosome size, largest on top
		MariaDB [biodb]> SELECT concat(genus, " ", species), round(gsize/1000,4), gsize/nchr, year(draft) FROM modorg ORDER BY gsize/nchr desc;
	COMPLETE + USE OF ALIAS
		MariaDB [biodb]> SELECT concat(genus, " ", species) as species, round(gsize/1000,4) as gsizeGb, gsize/nchr as avgChrSize, year(draft) FROM modorg ORDER BY avgChrSize desc;

Exercise slide 50
	Select all mammals with genomes published after 2005
		MariaDB [biodb]> SELECT * FROM modorg WHERE class="mammals" AND year(draft) > 2005;
	Select all organisms that have an average chromosome size between 10 and 100 Mbp
		MariaDB [biodb]> SELECT genus,species,gsize/nchr as avgChrSize FROM modorg WHERE gsize/nchr BETWEEN 10 AND 100;
	Select all organisms whose genus starts with A, B, C, D or E
		MariaDB [biodb]> SELECT * FROM modorg WHERE genus <"F" AND genus >= "A";
		MariaDB [biodb]> SELECT * FROM modorg WHERE genus LIKE "a%" OR genus LIKE "b%" OR genus LIKE "C%" OR genus LIKE "d%" OR genus LIKE "e%";
		MariaDB [biodb]> SELECT * FROM modorg WHERE genus rlike "^[A-E]+";

Exercise slide 53
	Give an overview of all (unique) organism CLASSES in the dataset (sorted alphabetically)
		MariaDB [biodb]> SELECT DISTINCT class FROM modorg ORDER by class;
	Show the organism names of the top 3 largest genome sizes
		MariaDB [biodb]> SELECT concat(genus, " ", species)as orgName,gsize FROM modorg ORDER BY gsize desc LIMIT 3;
	Show the organism names of the top 3 smallest genome sizes, not showing NULL values
		MariaDB [biodb]> SELECT concat(genus, " ", species)as orgName,gsize FROM modorg WHERE gsize IS NOT NULL ORDER BY gsize LIMIT 3;

Exercise slide 58
	How many organisms are present in the dataset for each class?
		MariaDB [biodb]> SELECT class,count(*) FROM modorg GROUP BY class; count(*) will count each of the buckets/groups how many rows are in there
		MariaDB [biodb]> SELECT class,count(class) FROM modorg GROUP BY class; (same result, mssh niet beste idee)
	Show the minimum and maximum genome sizes for each classTake only the organisms into account for which the sizes are known. Sort the results such that the biggest maximum genome size is on top
		MariaDB [biodb]> SELECT class,min(gsize),max(gsize) FROM modorg WHERE gsize IS NOT NULL GROUP BY class ORDER BY max(gsize) desc;
		MariaDB [biodb]> SELECT class,min(gsize) as min_gsize,max(gsize) as max_gsize FROM modorg WHERE gsize IS NOT NULL GROUP BY class ORDER BY max_gsize desc;
		note: you can use aliasses in ORDER BY, NOT in WHERE
